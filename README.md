This is my final project for Software System Analysis lecture.
In this final project we were tasked to create an application called Favorite Sites. 
This application's aims keeping track of the user's visits, sharing recorded visits and sorting-displaying recorded visits in various ways.
In this project i've used MySQL for all databases and i've used java for manipulating and querying database server.
